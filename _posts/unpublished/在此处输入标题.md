## Installation Guide

1. Build caffe. Noticed that you should remember to 'make pycaffe'.

2. run the demo.

``` 
$ python demo_test_video.py 
```

## Time cost

We use 'caffe time' to calculate the time cost of our network, using those commands:
```
$ ./caffe/build/tools/caffe time -model='./model/coarse/VGG16_1c_dep.prototxt' -gpu=0 -iterations=10
$ ./caffe/build/tools/caffe time -model='./model/fine/googlenet_seg_fine.prototxt' -gpu=0 -iterations=10
```

For the coarse network, we got the Average Forward pass: 5.56841 ms.
For the fine network, we got the Average Forward pass: 13.5205 ms.

So the total time cost of our coarse-to-fine network is less than 20ms/frame.
